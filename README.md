# Mapping the linked-list data structure scripted in C into MIPS assembly language

### Overview:
This project involves the translation of a linked-list data structure implemented in the C programming language into the MIPS assembly language.

### Execution Instructions:
To run the MIPS code, follow the steps outlined below:

- **Java Runtime Environment (JRE):** Ensure that the 'Java Runtime Environment' is installed on your system.

- **Mars MIPS Simulator:** Download the 'Mars MIPS simulator' from the official website.

- **Launch Mars MIPS Simulator:** Open the 'Mars.jar' file to start the Mars MIPS simulator.

- **Select Assembly File:** Load the MIPS assembly code file (with the '.asm' extension) within the Mars MIPS simulator.

- **Compile the Code:** Choose 'Run' => 'Assemble' to compile the MIPS assembly code.

- **Execute the Code:** Initiate the program execution by pressing the 'Run' button within the Mars MIPS simulator.

### Technical Details:
The project is designed to showcase the conversion of a linked-list data structure from C to MIPS assembly. The intricate details of the translation process highlight the nuances of implementing data structures in an assembly language environment.

This technical documentation provides a comprehensive guide for executing the LinkedList-C-MIPS project, ensuring a smooth experience in exploring the intricacies of MIPS assembly programming.
